# About Leet Lab DB
This folder contains the **database schema, views, stored procedures, triggers, and default data** required for the application. The database is **independent of any microservice** and serves as a shared resource.
## Overview
- All SQL scripts, including **schemas, views, stored procedures, and frequent queries**, are maintained here.
- **Prisma** and **prisma/client** is used for query building in microservices.
- The database repository runs **only when needed**, such as during a schema update.
